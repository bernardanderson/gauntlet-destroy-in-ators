# NSS Group Project: "Gauntlet"

### Specs:
> Have a randomly selected group create a game which utilizes prototypical inheritance:

1. Use base Web Technologies
 * HTML5
 * CSS
 * JavaScript

### Technologies Used:
> 1. HTML5, CSS, JavaScript
> 2. [jQuery 1.11.2](https://jquery.com/): Materialize interactions


### Final Result:
##### 8-bit Themed Graphical Battle Game
> Users create a character froma set of character "classes" that inherit statistics from a base object. Then the use selects a weapon which also inherits statistics from a base weapon.

> The user's character battles a randomly generated enemy in a 1-on-1 battle. Graphics were done using standard CSS transitions.

> This project was also a example of what a group of students working as a team could accomplish.

### How to run:
```
1. Go to: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server` and install "http-server".  
2. Navigate to the project folder in command line interface and type: `http-server -p 8080`  
3. This will show at: `http://localhost:8080` in your internet browser.  
```

### Original Specs:

Gauntlet game

Time to use protypal inheritance to build a game.

Some enterprising, young, software developer decided to build a simple web-based RPG that lets a human player fight against an array of different enemies. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough time to finish the project because aliens took over the Earth and everyone was shipped off to the plutonium mines.

Your job is to finish the game.

To do so, you need a firm understanding of prototypal inheritance. Start by examining the files `player.js`, `classes.js`, and `enemies.js` to see how the prototype chains were initially set up.

The game now belongs to you, intrepid adventurer. You can change the theme completely (aliens vs. undead, or axis vs. allies), style it however you want, but you need to have multiple classes, weapons, and enemies that the player can fight against.

Once the player has chosen all options for class, weapon, etc., you need to have a battlefield view that fulfills the following criteria.

1. Display the initial statistics for the player and the enemy.
2. Have a button with the label "Attack".
3. Each time the attack button is clicked, the player's chosen character and the generated enemy should attack with their weapon, and once the damage is calculated, subtract that from the opponents' health.
4. As soon as either combatant reaches health of 0, disable the attack button and annouce the winner.
